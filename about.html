        <p style="color: white;font-size: xx-large"> What is this website?</p>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: medium"> It's kink list builder, sometimes called BDSM list. You can use this
            site to generate an image that you can then share in online communties or to send to potential/current
            partners. Each rating changes color.</p>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: xx-large"> Do you take my privacy seriously?</p>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: medium"> Yes, I designed this site to work without ever uploading/saving or
            storing any data on this site. It works using your browser's local storage so your data stays is in your
            hands. This site was made in reponse of other services not being truly transparent with their data use or
            privacy policies. Our site does not store any data about your selections, we only capture
            very basic info about your connection to our site like your country, device type and where you came from
            using CloudFlare (service I use to manage the DNS for this domain deviantbound.com). This infomation DOES
            NOT include your IP or when you accessed the site, meaning it is not possible to identify you, plus
            cloudflare
            anonymizes your data from me on their side and gives basic info only and its only meant to show statitics
            about who is using your site, which I plan to use to see if I should add additional lanaguage support if it
            becomes popular in different countries. Don't believe me? Chrome Windows/Mac/Linux: Press F12 > Open Devolper Console > Application (Top) > Local Storage (Expand) > file:// > HERE ARE YOUR SELECTIONS.</p>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: xx-large">How did this project come to be?</p>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: medium">It was largely inspired by the project
            https://goctionni.github.io/KinkList/v1.0.2.html but the original author has not updated the project in over
            6 years. I wanted to update the project but found it easier to recreate one from scratch using modern tools
            and libaries. I am sucker for material design and dark themes and wanted to build better alternative.
            Additionally I wanted to add new features like better color blind accessiblity by using faces
            to imply emotion rather than colors alone.</p>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: xx-large">What is buiness model of this service?</p>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: small">This service is totally free and designed for privacy, for
            the BDSM community to benefit from.
            done. I am just crazy I am guess :)</p>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: xx-large">Some kinks are missing, why is that?</p>
        <p style="color: white;font-size: medium">I studied the kink list people generated on
            https://goctionni.github.io/KinkList/v1.0.2.html or its adapations. Dozens of kinks were not selected by
            users. Kinks like "sounding" or "Anal Fisting" are niche at best and were
            highly unpopular by general population. I wanted to
            focus on popular kinks that people who are new to BDSM may have interest or have been exposed too. People
            who take these types of test
            generally lean towards being new in the community in my experience. I felt it was overkill to include too
            many niche/taboo kinks, though I am considered making an "advance kink list", at some point in the future.
            Currently
            for sake of devolpment and space the kinks selected are what is avaiable.</p>
