        <h2>What is this website?</h2>
        <p> It's a kink list builder, sometimes called a BDSM list. You can use this tool to generate an image that you
            can share in online communities or send to potential/current partners. The BDSM community has immense
            diversity, tools like this aid in helping bring like-minded individuals together. Each category is
            represented at the top, whereas topics are represented below. The faces represent a user's feeling towards
            the topic. Due to topics/questions some are worded to ask "Receiving ( R ) vs. Giving ( G )" This denotes do
            you enjoy receiving X kink vs. giving. Additionally, some are listed as "S, or S and P" this denotes self or
            partner.</p>
        <h2>Do you take my privacy seriously?</h2>
        <p>Yes, I designed this site to work without ever uploading or saving your data on our servers. How? It works
            using your browser's "local storage", meaning your data stays is in your hands and is not uploaded to us.
            This site was made in response to other services not being truly transparent with their data use or privacy
            policies. We only capture very basic info about your connection to our site like your country, device type,
            and where you came from using the service CloudFlare.com (service I use to manage the DNS for this domain
            deviantbound.com). This information DOES NOT include your IP (or identifiable information) meaning it is not
            possible to identify you, it's purely used to help me know how the tool is being used, which can help me
            determine various things like if I need to invest in better web hosting or add new servers in different
            countries, or add additional language support.</p>
        <h2>How did this project come to be?</h2>
        <p>It was largely inspired by the project https://goctionni.github.io/KinkList/v1.0.2.html but the original
            author has not updated the project in over 6 years. I wanted to update the project but found it easier
            to recreate one from scratch using modern tools and libraries. I had several goals in this redesign to
            accomplish. I wanted to add new features like better colorblind accessibility by using faces to imply
            emotion rather than colors alone. Along with more vibrant/contrastable colors for people with partial
            color blindness.

            This site is made for a Discord community I have run since 2017, I wanted to make tools for the BDSM
            community (and for my own) given there has not been move movement in the space for alternatives. I
            wanted to build one from the ground up, then use its technology to work on additional upcoming projects
            for this site.

        </p>
        <h2>What is buiness model of this service?</h2>
        <p>kinklist.devintbound.com is totally free and designed for privacy, for you to benefit from. There is no
            google analytics or any of that jazz. There will be no plans to charge for this page, as the server is
            hosting strictly static HTML/JS content, therefore the cost with the domain and everything is minimal. I
            am great with business models :)
        </p>
        <h2>Some kinks are missing, why is that?</h2>
        <p>I studied the kink list people generated on https://goctionni.github.io/KinkList/v1.0.2.html or its
            adaptations. There was a large percent that steered away from more taboo kinks. I felt it would be an
            improvement to exclude these to make the list to make it more accessible to people unfamiliar with BDSM.
            Having a third of the list represented as a "limit" by the user was a bad experience and a common sight
            that I felt could be improved on. I choose to remove "sounding" and "anal fisting" among others that
            were not commonly selected to do just that. I do have some plans to add a more advanced test to include
            these for people to express themselves fully, but admittedly this project has exceeded 15000 lines of
            code and well over 60 hours with selections present now, so taking a break :) If you want a specific
            kink to be included in this planned update please send an email to contact@deviantbound.com with your
            kink names that you feel should be added, I will my best to add them when the time comes for that
            project update (When: TBD).
